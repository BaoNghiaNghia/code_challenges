**Tamboon React** is a code challenge for frontend developer.

## Scenario
Once upon a time.. nope!  
So here, you have been temporarily hired by Omise and assigned to work on the charity donation project which the previously assigned front-end developer and designer got the urgent matters to solve, so they will not be able to finish the project on time..

Fortunately, the API server is already done. You will need to grab on the requirements and complete the project while ensuring the application to have great engineering and well-design âœ¨

## Getting started

```

Now open [http://localhost:3005](http://localhost:3005).

### ENV vars

React Project will use environment variables to know how to build for
production v. development.  For local development, you can edit the
`.env` file to change environment variables, in production you'll want
to set them on the box.

#### Typical Production Environment variables

```
NODE_ENV=development
```
